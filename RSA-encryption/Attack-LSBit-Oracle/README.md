# Least Significant Bit Oracle Attack

Prerequisites:
1. [RSA Encryption/Decryption](../../RSA-encryption/README.md)

This attacks works due to leaking of the Least Significant Bit by an unpadded RSA encryption/decryption oracle that enables the adversary to decrypt the ciphertext in ![picture](Pictures/1.gif) requests to the oracle. In this article we will try to understand the logic and details behind LSB oracle attack on unpadded RSA.

## Background

Consider the following scenario:  
We have access to a service that allows us to encrypt/decrypt text using unpadded RSA. The service encrypts/decrypts using it's public key and private key respectively. After decryption, the server only returns the last bit of the plaintext obtained. How can such a service be vulnerable?

An illustration of how the encryption/decryption described above could take place in the server:

```python
def _encrypt(message, e, n):
    m = bytes_to_long(message)
    return long_to_bytes(pow(m, e, n))

def _decrypt(ciphertext, d, n):
    ct = bytes_to_long(ciphertext)
    return long_to_bytes(pow(ct, d, n) % 2)

def genkey(size):
    p = getPrime(size/2)
    q = getPrime(size/2)
    e = 65537
    phin = (p-1)*(q-1)
    d = inverse(e, phin)
    n = p*q
    return (p, q, e, d, phin, n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p, q, e, d, phin, n = genkey(1024)
    flag = open("flag").read().strip()
    print "Welcome to RSA encryption oracle!"
    print "Here take your flag (in hex): ", _encrypt(flag, e, n).encode("hex")
    print "Here take modulus: ", n
    for i in range(1050):
        print "RSA service"
        print "[1] Encrypt"
        print "[2] Decrypt"
        option = int(raw_input("Enter your choice: "))
        if option == 1:
            try:
                message = raw_input("Enter the message you want to encrypt (in hex): ").decode("hex")
            except:
                print "Enter proper hex chars"
                exit(0)
            ct = _encrypt(message, e, n)
            print "Here take your ciphertext (in hex): ", ct.encode("hex")
            print "\n\n"
        elif option == 2:
            try:
                ciphertext = raw_input("Enter the ciphertext you want to decrypt (in hex): ").decode("hex")
            except:
                print "Enter proper hex chars"
                exit(0)
            msg = _decrypt(ciphertext, d, n)
            print "Here take your plaintext (in hex): ", msg.encode("hex")
            print "\n\n"
        else:
            print "Enter a valid option!"
    print "Exiting..."
```

# Vulnerability and Exploit
From the scenario discussed in the last section, we know that the service returns the last bit of the decrypted ciphertext, ie. ![picture](Pictures/2.gif)  


Some observations before we can exploit the vulnerability:
1. Modulus n = p*q where `p` and `q` are primes. Since primes cannot be even and multiplication of two odd numbers is another odd number, `n` is always odd.
2. If we multiply any plaintext by multiples of `2`, the result will always be even, regardless of whether the plaintext is even or odd.

Suppose `ct` is the ciphertext of message `m` we want to decrypt, `e` is the public key exponent and `n` is the modulus.  

We can get the plaintext by choosing a ciphertext such that after sending `q` number of requests, we are able to get the corresponding plaintext of the ciphertext we want to decrypt. This is known as chosen-ciphertext-attack.  

If we send ![picture](Pictures/3.gif) to the server as the ciphertext (where i=0,1,2,...,(n/e)), it will decrypt to ![picture](Pictures/4.gif) and the server will return ![picture](Pictures/5.gif).

Suppose we send ![picture](Pictures/6.gif) to the server as the ciphertext which will be decrypted to ![picture](Pictures/7.gif). Two cases can arise:  
1. If `2*m > n`, then the server will return `1` as the output (since 2\*m is even, m < n and `1` would be returned only when 2\*m > n) and then we can write `m > n/2`
2. If `2*m < n` then the server will return `0` as the output. We can then write `m < n/2`

Consider two messages 2\*m and 4\*m [\[1\]](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/11053/rsa-least-significant-bit-oracle-attack) and let us see under what values of the output, do we get the range of `m`:  
1. **even**, **even**: `m < n/4`
2. **even**, **odd**: `n/4 < m < n/2`
3. **odd**, **even**: `n/2 < m < 3n/4`
4. **odd**, **odd**: `(3/4)n < m < n`  

You must be wondering how condition 3 and 4 above hold true. You will understand better when you see the script implementing this:  
```python
e = 65537
upper_limit = 1
lower_limit = 0
denominator = 1

flag = ""
i = 1
# for 1024 bit N
while i <= 1024:
    chosen_ct = long_to_bytes((bytes_to_long(flag_enc)*pow(2**i, e, N)) % N)
    output = _decrypt(chosen_ct)
    delta = upper_limit - lower_limit
    upper_limit *= 2
    lower_limit *= 2
    denominator *= 2
    if ord(output[-1]) == 0:
        upper_limit -= delta
    elif ord(output[-1]) == 1:
        lower_limit += delta
    else:
        throw Exception
    i += 1

# Decrypted ciphertext
flag = upper_limit * N / denominator
print long_to_bytes(flag)
```

Now try understanding the conditions 3 and 4 using the above script:
1. In case 3, where the output is (**odd**, **even**): After sending 2\*m for which the result is odd, `lower_limit` becomes n/2, if we consider execution using the above script. When we send 4\*m for which the result is even, `upper_limit` is evaluated as `(lower_limit + upper_limit)/2` = (n/2 + n)/2 = 3n/4. Hence, `lower_limit < m < upper_limit` = `n/2 < m < 3n/4`
2. In case 4, where the output is (**odd**, **odd**): After sending 2\*m for which the results is odd, `lower_limit` becomes n/2, if we consider execution using the above script. When we send 4\*m for which the result is odd, `lower_limit` again evaluates to `(lower_limit + upper_limit)/2` = (n/2 + n)/2 = 3n/4. In this case, `upper_limit` value did not change and remained equal to `n`. Hence `lower_limit < m < upper_limit` = `3n/4 < m < n`.


It is somewhat similar to binary search algorithm, because our attack is doing the same (lowering the range of `m` until we get `m`), hence the complexity of this attack is **log<sub>2</sub>n**.

Note that we keep track of the numerators and denominators separately, or else we end up with a messed up last byte from truncating along the way.

I have written a script illustrating a server vulnerable to this attack, which you can find here: [encrypt.py](encrypt.py). You can also find the script I wrote to attack the above vulnerable service, which you can find here: [exploit.py](exploit.py)  

You can check out a general implementation of this attack (that can be used for solving CTF challenges) here: [lsbitoracle.py](lsbitoracle.py).
