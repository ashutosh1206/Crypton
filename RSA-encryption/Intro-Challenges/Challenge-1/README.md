# Challenge-1
  
**Level**: 1  
  
**Description**: A simple walkthrough over how `unpadded RSA encryption` works. You are given the ciphertext encryted using RSA in `ciphertext.txt` and `encrypt.py` is used to encrypt the flag. Read how the encryption works from `encrypt.py`, calculate d using p,q given and hence get the flag.
