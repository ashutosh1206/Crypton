**Level**: 2  
  
**Description**: Alice wants to send the same message to 4 different people. So, for this he generates 4 different public key pairs, encrypts the same message 4 times, generates the corresponding ciphertexts and sends each ciphertext to each person. We have the public key parameters for each person. Find the vulnerability, and find out what Alice is sending!
